Release is aimed to support new ES2015 build of OpenLayers

**Upgrade notes**
* Current version is build to work with [ol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol) package, you should install it to work inside Node env
* Public export have been changed for Node and Browser setups.  
Example of usage:
```js
// Node
import * as tileCacheUrlFn from 'ol-tilecache'
// or import separate methods
import { createTileUrlFunction } from 'ol-tilecache'
// CommonJS
const tileCacheUrlFn = require('ol-tilecache')
// In browser through script tag
ol.tileCacheUrlFn.*
```
**NOTE In browser setup through `script` tag you also need standard [openlayers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openlayers) package (see README.md)**
